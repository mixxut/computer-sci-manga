<h3 class="title">My favorit manga</h3>

<p class="parParContent">My favorite Manga is One Punch man by One. One punch man sits at the top as my favorite manga for three reasons the characters, the art and the plot.
The Characters are interesting and the weird traits they possess means they find themselves in hilarious situations while still retaining a sense of seriousness to the character. 
The weird situations the characters get into serve as a means to drive the plot forward in an interesting way.
The well thought out character driven plot coalesce with the accurate drawings representing the situation perfectly. 
It is by far my favorite manga for those reasons. </p>
